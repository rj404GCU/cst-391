#### Research Questions

**1. Describe @Input decorator used in info.component.ts**

     The @Input decorator helps the application identify the data and move it to the view. This passes the provide input to the view to customize the view to include information related to that data. 

**2. Describe [value] used in info.component.html**

     [value] is used to keep track of string values that are in the given object. 

**3. Describe [(ngModel)] also used in info.component.html**

     [(ngModel)] is like [value] but is used to keep track of object values that are in the given object.

    //loops through albums list and adds the artist object and 
    //saves it to the list
    this.albums.forEach(a => artistSet.add(a.artist));

    //loops through albums list and adds the artist name and saves it to 
    //the artistSet at the end
